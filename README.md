Django Starter Pack
Welcome to my Django Starter Pack! This repository serves as a basic foundation for getting started with Django, the popular Python web framework. 

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up your Django project using this starter pack:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-starter-pack.git

Create a Virtual Environment: 
It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create a new virtual environment with your preferred tool (e.g., venv or virtualenv).

# Using venv (Python 3.x)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv/bin/activate

Install Django 

# Install Django
pip install django

Database Setup: 
Configure your database settings in the settings.py file, and then run the following commands to set up your database:
# Create the database tables
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (admin) for the Django admin panel
python manage.py createsuperuser

Run the Development Server: Start the Django development server.

python manage.py runserver

Access the Admin Panel: 
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to access the Django admin panel. Log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier.

Start Building: 
With everything set up, you can start building your Django web application by adding models, views, templates, and more.
